INTENDED AUDIENCE

This mission is primarily intended for the Task Group Warrior (taskgroupwarrior.info) server however I have put it up so that any one can if they wish choose to run it, though I would appreciate it if you did let me know.
The mission requires some server side set up so be aware of this! It can't run 'stock' dcs as it uses all three of the io,lfs and os lua commands so these NEED to be undesanatized in the missionScripting.lua (look on the forums there are more then enough posts about how to do this).
It also requires that you install Simple Slot Blocker onto the server and set it up how you want it (server scripts).

The Mission itself runs a perpetual war between Blue and Red coalitions, saving the positions of the Ground units, who controls what air bases (for Gudauta, Sukhumi,Kutasi,Senaki,Kobuleti at the current time) what damage has been done to scenary, what CTLD units are active etc every 60 seconds.

It has a number of commands that can be used by admins and players for controlling items as well.

LIMITATIONS: a lot but the mission is slowly progressing, one of the biggest limitations is DCS itself! trying to keep it from bogging down in the mission. As such this missions designed to restart every 6 hours.

Generally look at the lua files and the like. I'll try and keep this repo up to date but it may end up out by a week or so.
